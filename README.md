# Drupal Wayback

This is a showcase of all major Drupal versions from Drupal 1 to 11.

A lot of these legacy versions are no longer supported, and it's difficult to get some working properly (e.g. Drupal 1, 2 and 3). However, thanks to [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) we are able to experience what it was like over 20 years ago. 

## Pre-requisite

You must have the following applications:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) 


## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change directory to any of the versions e.g. `cd drupal7`
3. Run `ddev build`
4. Run `ddev launch` to view the site in your default browser.
